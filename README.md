# Hangman_Game
Hangman (Links to an external site.) is a simple two-player game in which one player thinks of a “secret word” and the second player tries to figure out the secret word by guessing one letter at a time. If the second player correctly guesses all the letters, she wins; if the second player runs out of incorrect guesses, she loses.
Here you are asked to implement hangman with the computer acting as the first player, in which it uses a dictionary file to select the secret word.
